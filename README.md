Repository for project submission of an event organised in Aparoksha19

Steps to run: 
1. `cd client`
2. `yarn` or `npm install`. Prefer the yarn version.
3. `yarn start`

Tasks attempted:
1. Login page for moderator. ( Referred to as admin in the web-app). Available on localhost:8080/adminLogin
2. Login page for user. Available on localhost:8080/userLogin
3. User - ambulance booking. Available on localhost:8080/user
4. Admin - ambulance add, edit and listing of available ambulance services. Available on localhost:8080/admin/.

Please note that, functionality is not integrated with the server, hence edit/add do not work. Although, could have done on client side with a little extra time :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Thanks for the event.:+1: Would have loved if some snacks were given.:stuck_out_tongue:
