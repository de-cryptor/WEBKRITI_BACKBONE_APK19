1--The Landing Page where Users and Clients can  login and register has been made as in frontend but in the backend both the user and the client counterpart is leading to the same page even though they are being coded to land on seperate pages.

2--The User Login and Signup page is also done in the front-end part but in the back-end part dues to some issue regarding 'passport js' they are not directing to pages correctly even though they are adding data to the databbase.

3--Same as that of User login Happened with the Client Login and Signup

4--The Show page to show the user of the ambulances available was made but could not work and the message feature was not working properly with the message not reaching the recepient.
